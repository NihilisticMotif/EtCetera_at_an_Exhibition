# EtCetera_at_an_Exhibition

I have created a new repository for my conputer science lectures, which is dedicated to exploring computer vision, image processing, and AI Art. I am particularly fascinated by how AI expresses its creativity in these domains. Furthermore, this field offers the advantage of easily inspecting the visual outputs of models, and it has practical applications that are highly useful.

While the primary focus of this lecture series is on the aforementioned topics, I have also included lectures on subjects that may not be directly related to this field, such as Linear Regression and Normal Distribution. The reason for this inclusion is my personal interest in these concepts, and I believe that it can be beneficial to start with simpler versions of concepts before delving into more complex ones. This approach helps build a solid foundation for understanding the broader scope of data science.

If there is some thing wrong and/or you have any opinion about my lecture and my project, you can contact me at my gmail (nihilisticmotif@gmail.com)

Thankyou for reading my lecture.

Also, thanked ChatGPT for improving my English language writing.
